## Important Note
Honestly, within this project, not all of the flow of the ideas, that I have only come up with, are being implemented.<br> 

So I have summarized them generally as an overview of my ideas on this [flowchart](./docs/general_diagram.md) on how to implement user anonymity, real-time messaging, and driver chat via pop-up link.<br>

But I also have the sequence diagram of the ideas that provide more details about the flow of the ideas, as shown on this [diagram](./docs/sequence_flowchart.md). Enjoy !
